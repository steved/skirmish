Semi-realistic (sort of arcade) historical (pre-gunpowder) battle simulator. Sort of a rip of Rome Total War's battles.
May have sieges at some point.
Things that need to happen:
Maps
  - Terrain
    - 2d topography?
    - high ground = better
  - Water
  - Grass (neutral?)
  - Desert 
  - Plain (neutral?)
  - Being able to hide
    - forests
    - tall grass
Units
  - Calvary
    - Limited armor to full
    - Ranged attacks
  - Artillery
    - Archers
    - Onagers
    - Trebuchets (?)
  - Infantry
    - Spearmen
    - Swordsmen
  - Combo artillery + infantry
  - Combo calvary + artillery
Zooming
  Should be able to zoom and see more individual units or zoom out and see unit grouped by division
  Basically, at 1x you see units grouped with like units (aka 30 infantry, 20 archers, etc)
  But if you zoom in you can see individual units (and control them?)
  And if you zoom out you can see them grouped by division (aka those 30 infantry and 20 archers are 1 division)
Strategy
  Able to place units before the beginning of the battle (aka no movement costs)
  Able to move units during battle for strategy (takes time, makes them tired, etc)
  - maybe able to draw strategies before battle even starts
    - if you can see enemy first (aka ambush?)
  - should always be able to see where a unit is going from individual up to largest
